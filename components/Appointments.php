                <p class=" about-para">Welcome to Half Full Psychiatry. Kindly provide us your insurance information
                    through the initial form at least 2 to 3
                    days in advance of your appointment. You must also email us your insurance card to determine your
                    eligibility with
                    us. Please be advised that once you schedule an appointment we exclusively reserve it for you,
                    therefore we have

                    a 48 hour re-scheduling/cancellation fee policy and there is no exception to this. Hope to see you
                    soon!.</p>
